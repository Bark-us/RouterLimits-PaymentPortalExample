### Serving Code

The code is written in Typescript using the Angular 8 Framework. This web app requires a web server to run. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) offers an extremely simple and secure way to serve this web app using a custom domain and SSL encryption. There is a free plan which provides enough functionality to run this web app for now.
